Issues are a feature within GitHub that enables to create a to-do list of tasks for our project. Issues can be used to specify a new feature to be created,describe an issue to be fixed or to provide feedback and share ideas.

They have a number of features that can be used to help you manage a project and can be assigned to to individuals or groups.

## Creating an Issue

We can view any existing issues or create a new one via `Issues` on the GitHub toolbar.

In the detail of the Issue we can specify our definition of 'done' for this task.

We can also specify what type of task it is using the `Labels`, in this instance it is an `Enhancement`.

Once we are happy with our definition of the issue we can click on `Create`.

## Create an Issue

Create a new Issue in your GitHub repository.

## Closing an Issue

Sometimes an issue may be created that we learn is not needed. These can be deleted via `Delete issue`.

However, usually we choose to `Close issue`. We would choose to close an issue either after a task has been completed or a discussion has come to an end.

To close an issue:
- Open the issue to be closed, via `Issues`
- Enter a comment to explain why the Issue is to be closed
- Click on `Close issue`.

If a branch was created from the issue. The issue will automatically closed when the branch is merged.

Much more detailed information about creating and managing Issues is available via the GitHub documentation: [About issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues)
