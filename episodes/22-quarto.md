## Data analysis reports

Data analysts tend to write a lot of reports, describing their
analyses and results, for their collaborators or to document their
work for future reference.

Many new users begin by first writing a single R script containing all of their
work, and then share the analysis by emailing the script and various graphs
as attachments. But this can be cumbersome, requiring a lengthy discussion to
explain which attachment was which result.

Writing formal reports with Word or [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)
can simplify this process by incorporating both the analysis report and output graphs
into a single document. But tweaking formatting to make figures look correct
and fixing obnoxious page breaks can be tedious and lead to a lengthy "whack-a-mole"
game of fixing new mistakes resulting from a single formatting change.

Creating a report as a web page (which is an html file) using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html)
makes things easier.
The report can be one long stream, so tall figures that wouldn't ordinarily fit on
one page can be kept at full size and easier to read, since the reader can simply
keep scrolling. Additionally, the formatting of a Quarto document is simple and easy to modify,
allowing you to spend more time on your analyses instead of writing reports.

::: callout
You might also have heard about [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) as a literate
programming tool. In a lot of ways, Quarto is the
[next-generation version of R Markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/faq/rmarkdown.html)
with more advanced features and multi-language support. However, at its core, Quarto still
works the same as R Markdown when it comes to R-based documents and R Markdown files (`.Rmd`)
are still compatible with Quarto. Much of what we cover in this episode is thus also valid
for traditional R Markdown files.
:::


## Literate programming

Ideally, such analysis reports are *reproducible* documents: If an
error is discovered, or if some additional subjects are added to the
data, you can just re-compile the report and get the new or corrected
results rather than having to reconstruct figures, paste them into
a Word document, and hand-edit various detailed results.

The key R package here is [`knitr`](https://yihui.name/knitr/). It allows you
to create a document that is a mixture of text and chunks of
code. When the document is processed by `knitr`, chunks of code will
be executed, and graphs or other results will be inserted into the final document.

This sort of idea has been called "literate programming".

When rendering a document, `knitr` will execute the R code in each chunk and
creates a new markdown (`.md`) document, which will include both the regular text
and output from the executed code chunks. This markdown file is then converted to the final
output format with [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/). This whole process is handled for you
by the *Render* button in the RStudio IDE.

## Creating a Quarto document

Within RStudio, click `File → New File → Quarto document...` and
you'll get a dialog box like this:

![](fig/New_Quarto_Document.png){alt='Screenshot of the New Quarto Document dialogue box in RStudio'}

You can stick with the default (HTML output), but give it a title.

## Basic components of R Markdown

The initial chunk of text (header) contains instructions for Quarto to specify what kind of document will be created, and the options chosen. You can use the header to give your document a title, author, date, and tell it what type of output you want
to produce. In this case, we're creating an `html` document.

```yaml
---
title: "My Quarto document"
author: "John Doe"
format: html
editor: visual
---
```

You can delete any of those fields if you don't want them
included. The double-quotes aren't strictly *necessary* in this case.
They're mostly needed if you want to include a colon in the title.

RStudio creates the document with some example text to get you
started. Note below that there are chunks like

````
```{r}
1 + 1
```
````

These are chunks of R code that will be executed by `knitr` and replaced
by their results. More on this later.

## Markdown

Markdown is a system for writing web pages by marking up the text much
as you would in an email rather than writing html code. The marked-up
text gets *converted* to html, replacing the marks with the proper
html code.

For now, let's delete all of the stuff that's there and write a bit of
markdown.

You make things **bold** using two asterisks, like this: `**bold**`,
and you make things *italics* by using underscores, like this:
`_italics_`.

You can make a bulleted list by writing a list with hyphens or
asterisks with a space between the list and other text, like this:

```markdown
A list:

* bold with double-asterisks
* italics with underscores
* code-type font with backticks
```

or like this:

```markdown
A second list:

- bold with double-asterisks
- italics with underscores
- code-type font with backticks
```

Each will appear as:

- bold with double-asterisks
- italics with underscores
- code-type font with backticks

You can use whatever method you prefer, but *be consistent*. This maintains the
readability of your code.

You can make a numbered list by just using numbers. You can even use the
same number over and over if you want:

```markdown
1. bold with double-asterisks
1. italics with underscores
1. code-type font with backticks
```

This will appear as:

1. bold with double-asterisks
2. italics with underscores
3. code-type font with backticks

You can make section headers of different sizes by initiating a line
with some number of `#` symbols:

```markdown
# Title

## Main section

### Sub-section

#### Sub-sub section
```

You *compile* the R Markdown document to an html webpage by clicking
the "Render" button in the upper-left. Or using the keyboard shortcut
<kbd>Shift</kbd>\+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>\+<kbd>K</kbd> on Windows and Linux,
or <kbd>Shift</kbd>\+<kbd>Cmd</kbd>\+<kbd>K</kbd> on Mac.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Challenge 1

Create a new Quarto document called "Data analysis with the AMR Package"

Delete all of the R code chunks
and write a bit of Markdown (some sections, some italicized
text, and an itemized list).

Convert the document to a webpage.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution to Challenge 1

In RStudio, select `File > New file > Quarto Document...`

Delete the placeholder text and add the following:

```markdown
# Introduction

## Background on R package

This report uses the **AMR R package** to carry out standardised and reproducible Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) data analysis.

## Background on the AMR example data set

The AMR package contains a data set called **example_isolates_unclean** which is representative of data extracted directly from microbiology testing laboratories. 
```

Then click the 'Render' button on the toolbar to generate an html document (webpage).


:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## A bit more Markdown

You can make a hyperlink like this:
```
[The AMR Package for R](https://amr-for-r.org/)
```
You can include an image file like this: 
```
![AMR for R logo](https://amr-for-r.org/logo.svg)
```

You can do subscripts (e.g., F~2~) with `F~2~` and superscripts (e.g.,
F^2^) with `F^2^`.

If you know how to write equations in
[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), you can use `$ $` and `$$ $$` to insert math equations, like
`$E = mc^2$` and

```
$$y = \mu + \sum_{i=1}^p \beta_i x_i + \epsilon$$
```

which will show as

$$y = \mu + \sum_{i=1}^p \beta_i x_i + \epsilon$$


You can review Markdown syntax by navigating to the
"Markdown Quick Reference" under the "Help" field in the
toolbar at the top of RStudio.

## R code chunks

The real power of Quarto comes from
mixing markdown with chunks of code. When
processed, the R code will be executed; if they produce figures, the
figures will be inserted in the final document.

The main code chunks look like this:

````
# Loading the required R packages:
```{r}
#| warning: false
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(AMR) # load the AMR package

# (if not yet installed, install with:)
# install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "AMR"))
```
````

That is, you place a chunk of R code between <code>\`\`\`{r}</code>
and <code>\`\`\`</code>. You should give each chunk
a unique name, by inserting the line `#| label: label_name`
as they will help you to fix errors and, if any graphs are
produced, the file names are based on the name of the code chunk that
produced them. You can create code chunks quickly in RStudio using the shortcuts
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>\+<kbd>Alt</kbd>\+<kbd>I</kbd> on Windows and Linux,
or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>\+<kbd>Option</kbd>\+<kbd>I</kbd> on Mac.

::: spoiler
### Code chunk options in R Markdown
In R Markdown, you add chunk labels by including them within the <code>\`\`\`{r}</code> line like so:

The AMR package contains a data set called example_isolates_unclean, which is representative of data extracted directly from microbiology testing laboratories:
````
# Let's have a look at the example_isolates_unclean data set: 
```{r}
head(example_isolates_unclean)
```
````
:::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Challenge 2
In this report we will take this uncleaned data set and prepare it ready for analysis, we would like the microorganism column to contain valid, up-to-date taxonomy, and the antibiotic columns to be cleaned to contain SIR values = Susceptible (standard dose effective), Intermediate (or Susceptible, Increased exposure; requires higher doses), or Resistant (not effective even at higher doses).

Add code chunks to:

- Use chunk for the preparation of uncleaned antimicrobial data sets
- Use the AMR `as.mo()` function in AMR to transform arbitrary microorganism names or codes to current taxonomy codes
- Use this function to clean up the bacteria column in our data set:

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution to Challenge 2

The `as.mo()` function in AMR can transform arbitrary microorganism names or codes to current taxonomy codes, this function supports different types of input for example:
````
## Taxonomy of microorganisms
```{r}
as.mo("Klebsiella pneumoniae")
```
````
````
```{r}
as.mo("K. pneumoniae")
```
````
````
```{r}
as.mo("KLEPNE")
```
````
````
```{r}
as.mo("KLPN")
```
````
The first character in output codes denote their taxonomic kingdom, such as Bacteria (B), Fungi (F), and Protozoa (P).

The AMR package also contain functions to directly retrieve taxonomic properties, such as the name, genus, species, family, order, and even Gram-stain: 
````
```{r}
mo_family("K. pneumoniae")
```
````
````
```{r}
mo_genus("K. pneumoniae")
```
````
````
```{r}
mo_species("K. pneumoniae")
```
````
````
```{r}
mo_gramstain("Klebsiella pneumoniae")
```
````
````
```{r}
mo_snomed("K. pneumoniae")
```
````
This function can be used to clean up the bacteria column in our data set:
````
```{r}
AMR_data_unclean <- example_isolates_unclean
AMR_data_unclean$bacteria <- as.mo(AMR_data_unclean$bacteria, info = TRUE)

#ℹ Microorganism translation was uncertain for "E. coli" (assumed Escherichia coli), "S. aureus" (assumed Staphylococcus aureus), and "S. pneumoniae" (assumed Streptococcus pneumoniae). Run mo_uncertainties() to review these uncertainties, or use add_custom_microorganisms() to add custom entries.
````

We can run this code to check on the taxonomic code translations:

````
```{r}
mo_uncertainties()
```
````
:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## How things get compiled

When you press the "Render" button, the Quarto document is
processed by [`knitr`](https://yihui.name/knitr) and a plain Markdown
document is produced (as well as, potentially, a set of figure files): the R code is executed
and replaced by both the input and the output; if figures are
produced, links to those figures are included.

The Markdown and figure documents are then processed by the tool
[`pandoc`](https://pandoc.org/), which converts the Markdown file into an
html file, with the figures embedded.

![](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/images/rstudio-qmd-how-it-works.png){alt='Schematic of the Quarto rendering process'}

## Chunk options

There are a variety of options to affect how the code chunks are
treated. Here are some examples:

- Use `echo=FALSE` to avoid having the code itself shown.
- Use `results="hide"` to avoid having any results printed.
- Use `eval=FALSE` to have the code shown but not evaluated.
- Use `warning=FALSE` and `message=FALSE` to hide any warnings or
  messages produced.
- Use `fig.height` and `fig.width` to control the size of the figures
  produced (in inches).

So you might write:

````
```{r}
#| label: load_libraries
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(AMR)
```
````

Often there will be particular options that you'll want to use
repeatedly; for this, you can set *global* chunk options in the files YAML header like so:

```yaml
---
...
knitr:
  opts_chunk:
    message: false
    warning: false
    echo: false
    results: "hide"
    fig.path: "Figs/"
    fig.width: 11
---
```
The `figures` block option defines the path where the figures will be saved. The `/` after Figs
here is really important; without it, the figures would be saved in
the standard place but just with names that begin with `Figs`.

If you have multiple R Markdown files in a common directory, you might
want to use `fig.path` to define separate prefixes for the figure file
names, like `fig.path="Figs/cleaning-"` and `fig.path="Figs/analysis-"`.

You can review all of the `R` chunk options by navigating to
the "R Markdown Cheat Sheet" under the "Cheatsheets" section
of the "Help" field in the toolbar at the top of RStudio.

## Challenge 3

## Cleaning antibiotic lab test results

The AMR package comes with three new data types to work with such test results: `mic` for minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC), `disk` for disk diffusion diameters, and `sir` for SIR data that have been interpreted already. This package can also determine SIR values based on MIC or disk diffusion values.

This data set just contains SIR data and we want to clean the SIR columns in our data using dplyr:

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution to Challenge 3

````
# Cleaning antibiotic lab test results
```{r}
AMR_data_clean <- AMR_data_unclean %>%
  mutate_if(is_sir_eligible, as.sir)

# mutate_if applies a function to all columns that meet a condition
# is_sir_eligible function returns TRUE if a column contains data that can be interpreted as antimicrobial susceptibility test results (e.g., MIC values, disk diffusion diameters, or categorical "S", "I", "R" results
# as.sir function then takes those eligible columns and converts their values into the "sir" class (standardized "S", "I", "R" format).

AMR_data_clean
```

## Challenge 4

## Data inclusion - first isolates
-   For analysis of antimicrobial resistance, only the first isolate of every patient per episode should be included (Hindler et al., Clin Infect Dis. 2007).
-   If this wasn't done we would get an overestimate or underestimate of the resistance of an antibiotic.
-   For example, if a patient was admitted with an MRSA infection and it was found in five different blood cultures the following weeks . The resistance percentage of oxacillin of all isolates would be overestimated, because you included this MRSA more than once. It would clearly be selection bias.
-   The `AMR` package includes this methodology with the [`first_isolate()`](https://amr-for-r.org/reference/first_isolate.html) function and is able to apply the four different methods as defined by [Hindler *et al.* in 2007](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/44/6/867/364325): phenotype-based, episode-based, patient-based, isolate-based. 

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution to Challenge 4
````
# Data inclusion - first isolates
```{r}
AMR_data_clean <- AMR_data_clean %>%
  mutate(first = first_isolate(info = TRUE))
```
````
This shows that only 91% of the isoaltes witin this data set are suitable for resistance analysis! We can now filter using the function `filter_first_isolate()`
````
```{r}
AMR_data_clean_1st <- AMR_data_clean %>%
  filter_first_isolate()

AMR_data_clean_1st
```
We now end up with a cleaned filtered data set with 2,724 isolates for analysis

````
:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge
## Challenge 5
## Data anlysis with the AMR package 

- Use the base R ```summary()``` function to get an overview of the cleaned and filtered data set and function ```sapply``` to get the number of unique values per column.
- Report how the species are distributed in the dataset using the ```count()``` funtion.
- Select and filter with antibiotic selectors.
  
:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution to Challenge 5

Use of the ```summary()``` and  ```sapply``` functions: 
````
```{r}
summary(AMR_data_clean_1st)

sapply(AMR_data_clean_1st, n_distinct)
```
````

Use of the ```count()``` function

````
```{r}
AMR_data_clean_1st %>%
  count(mo_name(bacteria), sort = TRUE)
```
````
We can select/filter columns based on the antibiotic class: 
````
```{r}
AMR_data_clean_1st %>%
  select(date, aminoglycosides())
```
````
````
```{r}
AMR_data_clean_1st %>%
  select(bacteria, betalactams())
```
````
:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Resistance percentages
The functions resistance() and susceptibility() can be used to calculate antimicrobial resistance or susceptibility. For more specific analyses, the functions proportion_S(), proportion_SI(), proportion_I(), proportion_IR() and proportion_R() can be used to determine the proportion of a specific antimicrobial outcome.

As per the EUCAST guideline of 2019, we calculate resistance as the proportion of R (proportion_R(), equal to resistance()) and susceptibility as the proportion of S and I (proportion_SI(), equal to susceptibility()).These functions can be used on their own:

````
```{r}
AMR_data_clean_1st %>% resistance(AMX)
```
````
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge
## Challenge 6 

- Use ```group_by()``` and ```summarise()``` from  dplyr together with the AMR ```resistance()``` function to determine the proportion of isolates that are resistant to amoxicillin for each hospital.
- Use the ```select()``` and ```summarise()``` functions together with the AMR ```resistance()``` function to determine the resistance proportions by antibiotic.
- Use ```group_by()``` and ```summarise()``` functions together with the AMR ```resistance()``` function to detmine the resistance proportions by antibiotic and grouped by bacteria.
  
:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution to Challenge 6

The proportion of isolates that are resistant to amoxicillin for each hospital: 
````
```{r}
AMR_data_clean_1st %>%
  group_by(hospital) %>%
  summarise(amoxicillin = resistance(AMX))
```
````
The resistance proportions by antibiotic: 
````
```{r}
AMR_data_clean_1st %>%
  select(AMX, AMC, CIP, GEN) %>%
  summarise(across(everything(), resistance))

```
````
The resistance proportions by antibiotic and grouped by bacteria: 

````
```{r}
AMR_data_clean_1st %>%
  group_by(bacteria) %>%
  summarise(across(c(AMX, AMC, CIP, GEN), resistance))

```
````
:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Inline R code

You can make *every* number in your report reproducible. Use
<code>\`r</code> and <code>\`</code> for an in-line code chunk. 

For example we can add in the following for our report: 

```
Using the AMR package example dataset, we analysed `r nrow(AMR_data_clean_1st)` isolates from `r length(unique(AMR_data_clean_1st$bacteria))` different bacterial species.

The overall resistance to ciprofloxacin was `r round(resistance(AMR_data_clean_1st$CIP) * 100, 1)`%.

The most common species was `r AMR_data_clean_1st %>% count(bacteria, sort = TRUE) %>% slice(1) %>% pull(bacteria)`.
```
## Inline example explained: 

r nrow(AMR_data_clean_1st)  = total number of isolates

r length(unique(AMR_data_clean_1st$bacteria)) =  number of species

r round(resistance(AMR_data_clean_1st$CIP) * 100, 1) = calculates the resistance % to CIP

r … %>% count(bacteria, sort = TRUE) = outputs the most frequent species

The code will be executed and replaced with the *value* of the result.

Don't let these in-line chunks get split across lines.

## Other output options

You can also convert R Markdown to a PDF or a Word document.
Change the `format: ` field in the YAML header to `pdf` or `docx`.
For an overview of all the available output formats, see the
[Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/all-formats.html)

## Parameterised reports

Literate programming with tools like Quarto and R Markdown is very powerful in
that it allows you to generate analysis reports in a reproducible manner.
This makes it very easy to update your work and alter the input parameters within the report
You can take this one step further, by parametrising the reports themselves.
This is very useful in a number of cases, for example:

* Running the same analysis on different datasets
* Generating multiple reports for different groups of the data (e.g. geographic location or time periods)
* Controlling the `knitr` options; e.g. you might want to show the code in some reports but not in others

### Including parameters in a Quarto document

Including parameters in a Quarto document (or R Markdown, which follows the same syntax) can be done
by adding the `params` field to they YAML header. This field can hold a list of multiple parameters.


For example, imagine we want to analyse the resistance distribution using the
our `AMR_data_clean_1st` dataset, but we want a separate report for each antibiotic. To achieve this, we set
the YAML header for our Quarto document, so if we wanted to calculate the resistance distribution for Ciprofloxacin, we would do as follows:

```yaml
---
---
title: "Data analysis with AMR package"
format: html
editor: visual
params:
  antibiotic: "CIP"
---
```

We can then reference this parameter anywhere in the R code in our report by accessing the
`params` object. To visualise the S/I/R distribution for just the antibiotic defined by the `params`,
we can do:

````
```{r}
AMR_data_clean_1st %>%
  ggplot(aes_string(x = params$antibiotic, fill = params$antibiotic)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_sir() +
  labs(title = paste(params$antibiotic, "S/I/R distribution"), x = "Interpretation", y = "Count")

```

````
This code also uses  `params` to set the plot title

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Challenge 7 
Plot the S/I/R distribution of Ciprofloxacin by hospital using `params`

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution to Challenge 7
````
```{r}
AMR_data_clean_1st %>%
  ggplot(aes_string(x = "hospital", fill = params$antibiotic)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  scale_fill_sir() +
  labs(title = paste(params$antibiotic, "S/I/R distribution by hospital"),
    x = "Hospital",
    y = "Proportion"
  )

```
````
:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Rendering Quarto documents from within R

Of course, manually editing the YAML header every time you want to generate a report
isn't much better than manually editing the report itself. The real power of parameterised
reports is when we render them *programmatically*. This can be done using the
[`{quarto}` R package](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-r), which provides
the `quarto_render()` function. This function takes a Quarto file and any execution parameters
as input.

So to generate the resistance distributions report for Gentamicin, we can write a script with the following
code:

```r
# render-report.R
library(quarto)
quarto_render("AMR_data_analysis.qmd", execute_params = list(antibiotic = "GEN"))

```

And now for the real magic, we can modify our script to render a report for a list of antibiotics from the AMR dataset: 

``` 
# render-all-reports.R
library(quarto)

antibiotics <- c("AMC", "CIP", "GEN", "AMX")

for (ab in antibiotics) {
  quarto_render(
    input = "AMR_data_analysis.qmd",
    output_file = paste0("AMR_", ab, ".html"),
    execute_params = list(antibiotic = ab)
  )
}
```
After running this script, we should have the following files in our working directory:

```
.
├── AMR_AMX.html
├── AMR_GEN.html
├── AMR_CIP.html
├── AMR_AMC.html
├── AMR_data_analysis.qmd

```

::: callout
**WARNING**: although this will work and generate the correct output files,
you might notice that each report will show the _exact same plot_, which is unexpected.
This is an [issue](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-r/issues/205) with the Quarto R package.

With R Markdown we don't have this issue, to render we would use the following code:

```r
library(rmarkdown)

antibiotics <- c("AMC", "CIP", "GEN", "AMX")

for (ab in antibiotics) {
  render(
    input = "AMR_data_analysis.Rmd",
    output_file = paste0("AMR_", ab, ".html"),
    params = list(antibiotic = ab),
    envir = new.env()  # avoids parameter bleed between runs
  )
}
```

## Challenge 8 
Use `params` and the AMR package function `resistance_predict` to predict the resistance trends for one antibiotic

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution to Challenge 8
````

```{r}
params$antibiotic_trend <- resistance_predict(
  x = AMR_data_clean_1st,   # <- your dataset
  col_ab = params$antibiotic, # column with S/I/R
  col_date = "date",        # column with Date
  model = "binomial",       # logistic regression
  year_max = 2025           # optional
)

# plot for one antibiotic

ggplot(params$antibiotic_trend, aes(x = year, y = observed)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(y = estimated), color = "purple") +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = se_min, ymax = se_max), alpha = 0.2, fill = "purple") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  labs(
    title = paste(params$antibiotic, "Resistance Trend"),
    x = "Year",
    y = "Resistance (%)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```

In an R Script, use to change antibiotic: 
# render-report.R

## Tip: Creating PDF documents

Creating .pdf documents may require installation of some extra software. The R
package `tinytex` provides some tools to help make this process easier for R users.
With `tinytex` installed, run `tinytex::install_tinytex()` to install the required
software (you'll only need to do this once) and then when you knit to pdf `tinytex`
will automatically detect and install any additional LaTeX packages that are needed to
produce the pdf document. Visit the [tinytex website](https://yihui.org/tinytex/)
for more information.

## Tip: Visual markdown editing in RStudio

RStudio versions 1.4 and later include visual markdown editing mode.
In visual editing mode, markdown expressions (like `**bold words**`) are
transformed to the formatted appearance (**bold words**) as you type.
This mode also includes a toolbar at the top with basic formatting buttons,
similar to what you might see in common word processing software programs.
You can turn visual editing on and off by pressing
the ![](fig/visual_mode_icon.png){alt='Icon for turning on and off the visual editing mode in RStudio, which looks like a pair of compasses'}
button in the top right corner of your R Markdown document.
